[^Note]: As of right now (May 16, 2024), HackerRank is experiencing an issue with accepting HTML project submissions.  It seems the error is with HackerRanks' API refusing a cross-origin request.  Here's a [screenshot of the error](screenshots/issue.png).  Submission screenshots will consist of the javascript and rendering of the code's functionality.
